% This file has some old classics as examples

% E.g. emacs is good for editing this file 
% because is has a separate bibtex mode which 
% gives additional menus for adding new refs.
%
% Put 'and' between author names!
% Use braces to get capital letters correctly in titles, 
%  e.g {System-on-Chip}.
% Use 'and others' to produce 'et al.' in your bibliography.
% The order does not matter for bibtex compilation 
%  (but affects understandability).

% Example of journal artcile
% --------------------------
% In Latex doc, type \cite{ref_id} to add ref to this record. 
% ref_id is of type <Firstauthor><Year><Letter>
% <Firstauthor> = last name of first author, e.g. salminen
% <Year>        = two numbers, e.g. 03
% <Letter>      = 'running number' to distinquish several refs of
%                 one author on a given year, start with a
% use only small case letters and no white spaces, e.g. salminen03a
% Explanations from: http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~jacobsd/bib/formats/bibtex.html

% journal = {A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals. }, 
% year = { The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, 
%          the year it was written. Generally it should consist 
%          of four numerals, such as 1984},
% OPTkey = {Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a
%           label when the ``author'' information is missing. 
%           This field should not be confused with the key that
