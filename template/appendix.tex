% improve it.


\appendix
\pagestyle{headings}



%
% a) Not-so-handy way, but at least it works
% 
\def\appA{APPENDIX A. Something extra} % Define the name and numbering manually
\chapter*{\appA}                       % Create chapter heading
\markboth{\appA}{\appA}                % Set page header
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\appA}  % Include this in TOC
% Note that \label does not work with unnumbered chapter

Appendices are purely optional.  All appendices must be referred to in
the body text

\def\appB{APPENDIX B. Something completely different} % Define another new command
\chapter*{\appB}                       % As above, but use \appB instead of \appA
\label{app:B}
\markboth{\appB}{\appB}                     
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\appB}  


You can append to your thesis, for example, lengthy mathematical
derivations, an important algorithm in a programming language, input
and output listings, an extract of a standard relating to your thesis,
a user manual, empirical knowledge produced while preparing the
thesis, the results of a survey, lists, pictures, drawings, maps,
complex charts (conceptual schema, circuit diagrams, structure charts)
and so on.


%
% b) The other option is to use numbered chapter and our baseline
% template report.cls numbers them as A, B... The heading and TOC do
% not include prefix 'Appendix' although the page header does.
%\chapter{name of the appendix}
%\label{app:A}                          % For cross-references
