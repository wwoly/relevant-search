The following chapter acts as a detailed introduction of the necessary background from literature.
First, different measurements that are utilized are introduced, 
both of which are generally used in e-commerce to measure success.
In addition to the measurements, the section introduces the testing platform utilized to collect the measurements
and to analyze the test results.

Second, the chapter introduces a search engine first at a more general level before introducing
Elasticsearch, the search engine utilized in this thesis, in more detail.
Lastly, the chapter introduces the ranking algorithms that served as a basis for the ones tested.
In addition to the ranking functions, the chapter introduces what the relevance of the search results means
as the purpose is to try to increase the conversion rate by offering more relevant search results to users.

\section{Measurements in e-commerce}
\label{sec:measurements}

The most popular metric to measure the success of an e-commerce platform 
is a metric called conversion rate,
which provides a percentage of conversions compared to the total visitor count.
Despite measuring the performance of a website accurately, 
a drawback of conversion rate is that a great deal of data is necessary for it to be an accurate measurement 
\cite{conversionRateWhat}.
In addition, the overall conversion rate measures small changes poorly, 
since it measures the performance of the whole website, so
additional measurements are necessary to measure more specific changes.


For instance, to measure the performance of a specific element on a website, 
the usage of the conversion rate might be redundant. 
Moreover, the specific element might not have a noticeable effect on it, 
thus making the conversion rate inaccurate measurement for that situation.
For specific situations, there exists a metric called click-through rate (CTR), 
which can measure the performance a small change efficiently \cite{ctrWhat}.


The following sections provide an overview of the different measurements used in e-commerce relevant to this thesis.
First, Section \ref{ss:conversion} talks about the conversion rate in e-commerce, and second, 
Section \ref{ss:ctr} describes a metric called click-through rate.
Lastly, Section \ref{ss:abtest} provides an overview of the test platform that was used
when collecting the results of the implementations.


\subsection{Conversion rate}
\label{ss:conversion}
The overall conversion rate measures the proportion of orders to the website visitors \cite{conversionRate}.
For example, if a total of one hundred customers visit a website and two of them place orders, 
the conversion rate can be calculated with a formula
\[conversions\ /\ total\ visitors\ *\ 100\% = conversion\ rate \]
resulting in a conversion rate of 2\%.

Although the conversion rate is not commonly the most accurate metric to be measured, 
it generally is the most significant for an e-commerce organization.
The preceding example was with 100 visitors, which is a far too low number to measure conversion rate accurately \cite{conversionRateWhat}.
Furthermore, in the example, one more converting customer would increase the conversion rate by 50\%,
making the measurement highly inaccurate.


It is important to note that there are other types of conversion rates in e-commerce \cite{conversionRate}.
The above conversion rate calculates the overall conversion rate of an e-commerce platform.
In addition to placing an order, the conversions can be, for instance, form submissions, signing up for a subscription 
or events that product is added to cart \cite{conversionRateWhat}.
Depending on the situation, other types of conversion measurements might be necessary 
to capture effects that might not be shown by the overall conversion rate.
Furthermore, the same formula applies to the different types of conversion rates.


In this thesis, the measured conversion rate was the overall conversion rate of the e-commerce platform and 
the conversion rate of the proportion of customers who interacted with the search application.
Furthermore, the conversion rates were used as a metric to measure the performance of the search applications
compared to the baseline.


\subsection{Click-through rate}
\label{ss:ctr}

Click-through rate (CTR) is a measurement used mostly to measure the performance of a specific element on a website, 
for example, an advertisement \cite{ctrWhat}. 
CTR is calculated similarly to the conversion rate,
by dividing the conversions, which are the clicks on the element,
by impressions, which means the number of visitors, who have seen the element \cite{ctrWhat}.


While CTR measures the clicks on a single element accurately, the usage differs based on the situation.
Generally, high CTR means that the element is highly relevant. 
However, for instance, in an advertisement, ambiguous keywords might receive high CTR while not necessarily being relevant.
\cite{ctrWhat}

As mentioned above, the CTR can measure more specific changes in the element. 
Therefore, it was utilized to measure the performance of the search result list with different implementations.
Furthermore, to be more precise, to collect the number of clicks on the search results and the position, which product
was clicked on.
Since in each implementation, the product list is different, the CTR was able to capture the 
difference between implementations well and provide insight to the results.

\subsection{Measurements with production A/B testing}
\label{ss:abtest}

The measurements were an essential part of determining the performance of the introduced methods.
Furthermore, the measurements were collected by utilizing the Google Optimize platform to conclude A/B tests
to calculate the measurements during the tests from the collected data.
An A/B test is a randomized test where the test platform splits the website, or part of it, into two or more variants, 
and the platform redirects the traffic for the website into the different variants at random \cite{optimizeAbout}. 
Therefore, when testing the different implementations, the user interface of the search that the customer sees does not change. 
Only the search results presented to the customer differ.


Google Optimize is a test environment, but in addition to operating the tests, 
it provides a tool to see a rough estimate of the results of the tests, 
based on the goals defined for the test, without extensive analysis \cite{optimizeAbout}. 
The tool can give a quick estimate of the results,
which is useful in determining if the implementation was performing as expected. 
Furthermore, the goals of the tests utilized 
in this thesis are introduced later in Section \ref{sec:methodTests}.


In order to reliably infer if the concluded tests have increased the conversion rate, 
a detailed analysis of the results of the tests was necessary. 
Therefore, Google Analytics was utilized for this since it 
provides a detailed report about the test variants based on the metadata collected on the website
\cite{analyticsAbout}.
The organization already collects data about the performance of products and product lists, 
so utilizing the existing platform was a logical choice.


Generally, the metadata includes the click data when a customer browses the website, the purchase data, 
and the data, which products are shown on different pages to different customers.
The collected metadata can be utilized in both the configuration and the analysis of the tests 
by setting up custom goals for tests. 
Therefore, the completion percentage of the custom goal during a test can be analyzed.
The primary goals for e-commerce, for example, revenue and conversion, 
can be tracked with the completion of the custom goals.
\cite{analyticsAbout}
 

The above sections introduced the metrics used in this thesis and how the measurements are
collected.
Firstly, the conversion rate served as the primary measurement used in this thesis 
since it is generally the most utilized measurement in e-commerce.
Secondly, the click-through rate was introduced, which was utilized to measure more
specific changes.
In this case, the performance of the search result list.
Lastly, A/B tests were introduced and how they work and use the measurements to determine
the best result from the test variants.
The following sections move on to introduced search engines first on a more general level before
introducing Elasticsearch, the search engine platform used, in more detail.


%% ==========================================================
\section{Utilization of a search engine}

As a general term, a search engine means an application that performs a query from a user and 
presents the user with the results for the specified query. 
Furthermore, the era of modern search engines can be thought to have started when
\citeauthor{googleInit} \cite{googleInit} created Google,
now the largest search engine. 
Furthermore, Google has been a large part of making search engines part of our everyday life.
To further understand how a search engine is utilized in this thesis, this section
provides an overview in necessary detail.
In addition, this thesis uses Elasticsearch as the search engine; it shares a considerable amount
of similarities to the early search engine of Google introduced by 
\citeauthor{googleInit} \cite{googleInit}.
Elasticsearch is introduced in detail in Section \ref{sec:elasticsearch}, but the general
background of the search engines applies to it.


\subsection{Overview}

Generally, search engines must be able to search from extensive datasets efficiently.
A design goal of \citeauthor{googleInit} \cite{googleInit} in \citeyear{googleInit}
was to build a large-scale search engine 
that would be able to index hundreds of gigabytes of data, in addition to
performing hundreds of millions of queries per day.
The above numbers have grown exponentially in the last two decades, and a present-day
search engine might need to perform the same amount of queries every hour.

Searching from persistent storage or disk was not feasible, and a more efficient 
solution was necessary \cite{googleInit}. 
Thus, the design goals of \citeauthor{googleInit} \cite{googleInit} included the creation of 
a distributed indexing system, 
which they could efficiently store the documents. 
In addition, the indexing system needed to be able to process hundreds of gigabytes of data efficiently 
due to the queries from the users came in with a rate of hundreds to thousands in 
a second \cite{googleInit}. 
Furthermore, the preceding design goal set by \citeauthor{googleInit} \cite{googleInit}
over two decades ago,
describes an outline for many of the modern search engines, 
including Elasticsearch \cite{relevantSearch}.

A search engine is a complex application to do simple string matching efficiently
on a large-scale.
However, to perform in a simple task efficiently, a search engine requires a great deal of 
engineering work.
In some cases, a simple spelling mistake can result in an empty set of documents, thus creating 
frustration towards the search engine.
\cite{relevantSearch}

To simplify the complex application,
\citeauthor{ganSuel} \cite{ganSuel} broke down a web search engine 
to four different steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collecting the data from a source.
    \item Preprocessing the data to a specified format.
    \item Indexing the documents and creating an inverted index to the search engine.
    \item Processing queries and searching from the index.
\end{enumerate}
Despite describing a web search engine, the preceding steps can be applied to various 
search applications. 
First, during the data collection, the search application in this thesis 
collects the data from persistent storage, which includes multiple databases and database tables.
Second, since the data includes numerous unnecessary fields 
and only a selection of them is necessary, the collected data must be preprocessed.
Third, the previous step yields a document with a specified schema from the data, 
that is indexed with Elasticsearch Index APIs.
Indexing both stores the document and creates an inverted index from the document to the search engine.
Lastly, the queries are processed and sent to the search engine. 
Furthermore, the search engine performs a search against the inverted index and yields the results for the query.


While the four steps describe a search engine in more detail, 
\citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} stated that 
a search engine consists of two major parts, the index time and the search time. 
Moreover, the first three steps are considered as the index time, which is described in Section \ref{ss:invertedIndex},
and the fourth step is the search time, described in Section \ref{ss:searchTime}.

\subsection{Creating the inverted index}
\label{ss:invertedIndex}

The inverted index is a central data structure of a search engine enabling 
matching query terms to the documents swiftly.
In worst cases, the fields in documents can contain an extensive amount of text, so 
finding a match from the documents can be costly.
The inverted index is created to solve the problem of going through all the documents 
every time a query must be performed. \cite{relevantSearch}


The inverted index consists of two crucial parts a terms dictionary and a postings list \cite{relevantSearch}.
\citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} introduced the following listings
describing how the inverted index is created in Elasticsearch.
The listing \ref{lst:docs} includes the example documents, which are indexed to a search engine.
\begin{lstlisting}[
caption={Example text documents with identifiers \cite{relevantSearch}.},
captionpos=b,
label={lst:docs},
frame=single]
    0. One shoe, two shoe, the red shoe, the blue shoe.
    1. The blue dress shoe is the best shoe.
    2. The best dress is the one red dress.
\end{lstlisting}
During indexing, a term dictionary (\ref{lst:terms}) is created by collecting all individual
terms called tokens from the documents. 
Furthermore, each of the terms has an identifier, which maps the term to the posting list (\ref{lst:postings}).
\begin{lstlisting}[
caption={Term dictionary is generated from terms in the documents \cite{relevantSearch}.},
captionpos=b,
label={lst:terms},
frame=single,
mathescape=true,
literate={=>}{$\rightarrow$}{1}
]
    best  => 0      red   => 5
    blue  => 1      shoe  => 6
    dress => 2      the   => 7
    is    => 3      two   => 8
    one   => 4
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[
caption={Postings list is a mapping between the term dictionary and documents
\cite{relevantSearch}.},
captionpos=b,
label={lst:postings},
frame=single,
mathescape=true,
literate={=>}{$\rightarrow$}{1}
]
    0 => [1,2]      5 => [0,2]
    1 => [0,1]      6 => [0,1]
    2 => [1,2]      7 => [0,1,2]
    3 => [1,2]      8 => [0]
    4 => [0,2]
\end{lstlisting}

In addition, the inverted index in Elasticsearch contains additional metadata necessary during the query evaluation
\cite{relevantSearch}. 
\citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} provided a full list of the metadata, and
the following list introduces a selection of the metadata from the list necessary for this thesis.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Document frequency} is a count of documents that contain the term, thus 
    establishing a notion of the importance of the term. 
    Generally, the higher the document frequency indicates that the term provides little value when 
    determining the relevance of the document to a query.
    For instance, the term \enquote{the} has a high document frequency providing little value 
    for the relevance calculation.
    \item \emph{Term frequency} determines how many times the term occurs in a document
    providing a notion of how well a query matches the document.
    In a nutshell, document 0 contains the term \enquote{shoe} four times and document 1 two times,
    making the document 0 twice as important match for the query term.
    \item \emph{Term positions} provide the position where the term occurs in a document. 
    It makes finding documents with phrase matching possible.
    \item \emph{Term offsets} keep track of the start and end character offsets. 
    For example, Google search provides highlights of the matches in the search result listing,
    which keeping track of the term offsets enables.
    The highlights provide feedback to the user on why the result matched the query.
    \item \emph{Stored fields} contain the necessary fields used during searching. 
    The fields in the inverted index are scrambled versions of the original document, and all fields 
    presented back to the user must be separately saved to the stored fields.
    Therefore, the fields might require a great deal of disk space depending on the size of the fields.
    \item \emph{Doc values} usually contain auxiliary values relevant to scoring the search results.
    For instance, the values used in sorting or boosting the results are stored in the doc values.
\end{itemize}

The above section provided an overview of the inverted index, the primary data structure of the search engine.
In addition, the data saved to the inverted index was introduced, as it is referenced in later chapters.
The following section continues to describe what index time means and how the inverted index is 
created in index time.

\subsection{Index time}
\label{ss:indexTime}

The index time can be viewed as an extracting, transforming, and loading information (ETL) pipeline \cite{relevantSearch}.
Furthermore, ETL pipelines are referred to when moving data from storage to another while processing it in between \cite{relevantSearch}.
In this thesis, the ETL pipeline steps for moving the data from persistent storage to the search engine are shown in Figure \ref{fig:etlPipe}.

The steps of the pipeline are extraction, which collects the product data from the persistent storage.
After the collection, the data is enriched with the additional data necessary to be searched.
Furthermore, Figure \ref{fig:etlPipe} shows the description of the product and impressions, which is the number of times the product has been viewed, both utilized in searching. 
The former, when matching the search query to a product, the latter, by the ranking algorithm in the relevance calculation.


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{img/etl-pipeline.eps}
    \caption{Index time described as an ETL pipeline \cite{relevantSearch}.}
    \label{fig:etlPipe}
\end{figure}

The third step is analysis, which in Elasticsearch happens during the indexing.
Before the metadata described in Section \ref{ss:invertedIndex} is collected from the document, 
a set of analyzers are utilized to create better terms \cite{elasticIntro}.
For instance, Figure \ref{fig:etlPipe} shows that all text from the document is lowercased, and 
the possessive ending from the title of Document 1 is removed \cite{relevantSearch}.
Elasticsearch does this by default to normalize the search terms to make the documents easier to find \cite{elasticIntro}.
In an ideal case, after the analysis step, a term with plural should match the term without one, thus, 
making both documents match a query with the term.
This thesis utilizes a set of analyzers to generate more generic search terms for specific fields.
Furthermore, the analyzers used are introduced in Section \ref{ss:textAnalysisTools}.


The last step of the ETL pipeline is to index the analyzed documents.
Furthermore, indexing is the process that saves the data to the inverted index and the storage of the search engine \cite{relevantSearch}.
Generally, the focus during indexing is on the computation performance and resource management
since the more the fields from the documents are analyzed, the slower the indexing becomes 
requiring more storage computation power and storage \cite{relevantSearch}.
In Elasticsearch, the analysis and the indexing happen automatically when 
a document or a set of documents is posted to the Index API \cite{elasticIntro}.

Searching from the field becomes available only when the field is indexed.
Consequently, making the decision between which fields to index, which to store, or which fields both index and store.
Storing the fields refers to saving original content to the metadata data structure introduced in Section \ref{ss:invertedIndex}.
\cite{relevantSearch}


As mentioned above, the utilization of a search engine can be divided into two parts, index time and search time.
The above section introduces what index time is and how the inverted index is created.
Furthermore, the following section continues to introduce what search time is and how 
the documents are searched from the index.


\subsection{Searching from the index}
\label{ss:searchTime}
A search engine is not an intelligent machine; instead, it is merely a text-matching tool \cite{relevantSearch}. 
When a query is submitted to the search engine, it 
matches the individual terms from the query to the tokens in the inverted index, 
which consequently map to the documents in the index \cite{relevantSearch}. 
Inverted index functions like the index from the end of books, 
where the reader can look for a specific topic and find the relevant page number \cite{relevantSearch}.
Searching for a specific subject from a book by going through page by page is not efficient.
Instead, the relevant pages can generally be found from the index much faster.
Furthermore, the same applies to the search engines;
the abundance of data generally makes searching the documents one by one unfeasible.


After a term matches a document, a content score for the match is calculated based on the metadata values in the index
\cite{relevantSearch}.
The content score determines how good of a match the document is to the query.
In addition to the content score, additional business scores can be calculated for the document to provide 
additional measurements of relevance.
Furthermore, the search engine sorts the resulting list in an order specified in the query, and generally, 
by default, the score determines the order of the resulting list. 
Thus, yielding in a list sorted by the relevance of the search result.


While the previous section provided an overview of the basic functionalities of a search engine,
the following section discusses how Elasticsearch works and how the functionalities are utilized in this thesis.
First, the section provides an overview of Elasticsearch, before moving on the various text analysis 
utilized when implementing the new search functionalities to the current search application.
Lastly, the section describes how the results are searched and scored in Elasticsearch before they 
are returned to the user.

\section{Ranking the search results}
\label{sec:ranking}

Ranking algorithms are generally integrated part of a search engine, at least in
the production scale engines, like Elasticsearch.
Furthermore, ranking algorithms are also widely researched topic, and this following
section introduces necessary ones which served as a base for the 
algorithm created for and utilized in this thesis.

Since the ranking algorithms are extensively studied field, and there are vast amounts of different solutions
about the ranking of the search results from machine learning methods like learning to rank functions
\cite{l2rEntitiesWeb, learningRankEC} to how different e-commerce platforms have utilized different ranking
functions \cite{amazonJoyRanking, predictionRelevanceSearchResults, turningClickPurhases}.
However, this research mainly focuses on using the built-in methods of Elasticsearch
when ranking the products by relevance, rather than using complicated methods, due to the time constraints.
While the need for more complicated ranking functions might be inevitable in the future,
it was not necessary for the first iteration of the new search application.


The ranking algorithms used in this thesis are mainly based on the methods used by
\citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} in their book.
They stated that the base score for a product comes from the content score, as mentioned previously,
and that additional business scores are added to it \cite{relevantSearch}.
In contrast, \citeauthor{enhancingSearchBestSelling} \cite{enhancingSearchBestSelling} achieved an 
increase in revenue when including the number of transactions from the day before in indexing
as the popularity measure for a product.

Furthermore, utilizing the popularity measure as one of the business scores, 
when calculating the score for the product in search time,
is significant and matches the needs of the organization effectively.
So, in this thesis, the proposed algorithm worked similarly, but instead of using the number of transactions
as the metric to calculate the relevance rating of a product, the number of product page visits was used.
Furthermore, this provided much more data points to be used to calculate the relevance rating.

This section gave an overview of the ranking algorithms relevant to this thesis. 
While there are a lot of complicated algorithms that could have been utilized, the choice to
build an own ranking function with already existing data was sufficient for this scope.
The following section continues to talk about the relevance of the search results 
and how the relevance can be measured in a way so the results can be compared.


%% ==========================================================
\section{Relevance of the search results}
\label{sec:relevance}

To be able to serve customers relevant search results to the queries, it is necessary first to understand 
what relevance is.
\citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} defined the relevance of the search results to be:
\begin{displayquote}
``Relevance is the practice of improving search results for users by satisfying their 
information needs in the context of a particular user experience, 
while balancing how ranking impacts our business’s needs.``
\end{displayquote}


In addition, \citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} argued that
relevance is subjective depending on the person who is using the search engine.
While two people can use the same search query, they value different things differently \cite{relevantSearch}.
For instance, two customers, both of whom search with the term ``samsung`` might have different 
information needs. 
The first customer is searching for refrigerators, and the second is searching for phones.
While both are equally relevant to the search term, both cannot be the first search result.


The solution which solves the example above is personalized search, but since that is out of the scope
of this thesis, more general measurements for the relevance were required.
\citeauthor{relevantSearch} \cite{relevantSearch} stated in the definition of relevance that the 
relevance also includes balancing the ranking in regards to the needs of the business.
Therefore, as previously mentioned, the score for the document comes from the content score;
in this case, the score based solely on the query what is relevant and business scores,
which again fills the needs of the organization.
Furthermore, the business score is usually deciding factor which products to show on top 
of the search results if the query matches both equally.


In information retrieval, relevance is purely based on how well the results match the query 
\cite{relevantSearch}.
However, in practice, relevance is more than satisfying the information needs; 
it also includes satisfying the needs of the business, which might depend on the context 
\cite{relevantSearch}.
For instance, in an e-commerce context, for general search terms, 
showing the products that are out of stock might not usually be relevant. 
While a product that is not in stock might meet the requirements of the query well, 
it does not satisfy the needs of the business, since the product cannot be sold.


So, to achieve some general relevance at first, a ranking algorithm that calculated
scores for the document based on the popularity rating of the product.
Furthermore, the popularity rating was calculated based on the number of visits on
the product page in the previous few days.
In theory, the product pages that customers visit are relevant to the customers, so in a way,
using the data based on the behavior of customers should satisfy the needs of the customers.
In addition to the popularity of the products, additional scores were added, and the scores were normalized,
but that will be introduced in more detail in Section \ref{ss:methodsRanking}


The above section provided an insight into what relevant search results mean.
Furthermore, defining and implementing a relevant search is a difficult task as
the relevance is not objective; instead, it changes depending on the user of the application.
However, before introducing how this thesis tried to achieve relevance, the following section 
describes the state of the current search application.
Furthermore, understanding the current state of the application is essential, so the 
changes proposed in the method section make sense.
